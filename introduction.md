# Introducing DigitalOcean's Engineering Code of Conduct

A code of conduct serves as a framework and guide to foster a pleasant, productive, and inclusive community. The engineering team at DigitalOcean believes that having a code of conduct helps us create a supportive environment for all team members, especially those who have faced more challenging work environments in the past or are members of underrepresented groups.

A code of conduct is designed to be a framework and a guide to, as the Recurse Center [eloquently phrased it](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules), "help all of us build a pleasant, productive, and fearless community." 

In developing our code of conduct, we researched best practices and drew inspiration from other organizations' codes and insightful blog posts. We believe in open-source principles, so we borrowed and adapted key elements (with attribution) from sources that resonated with our team's values.

One of our key inspirations is the Recurse Center's social rules, which promote constructive and respectful interactions: no feigning surprise, no condescending well-actually's, no backseat driving, and no subtle-isms. These rules address behaviors that can inadvertently discourage or marginalize others, even when unintentional.

Implementing and enforcing a code of conduct is essential for its success. We wanted to create a culture where violations can be addressed respectfully, and everyone feels empowered to speak up when needed. Recognizing that it can be challenging to address issues in the moment, we aimed to create an environment where open dialogue and learning from mistakes are encouraged.

We tailored our code of conduct to address specific aspects of our team and company dynamics, such as remote work and distributed teams. We included guidelines for effective communication and collaboration in a distributed environment, acknowledging the unique challenges that remote work can present.

Furthermore, we emphasized the importance of kindness when giving and receiving feedback. Healthy communication and constructive feedback are vital for a thriving organization, but can be difficult to navigate. Inspired by Kate Heddleston's article, we focused on fostering a culture of "constructive, not critical feedback" to facilitate long-term growth and positive relationships within our teams.

Focusing on giving "constructive, not critical feedback", as [Kate Heddleston wrote](https://kateheddleston.com/blog/criticism-and-ineffective-feedback), is fundamental to creating an environment conducive to long-term growth and positive relationships within teams.

Developing our code of conduct was a challenging and thought-provoking process that highlighted the complexities of shaping organizational culture. Nevertheless, we believe this exercise was essential for the healthy growth of our team, and we're excited to see how our organization evolves under the guidance of our updated Code.

We are proud of our updated Code of Conduct and have made it available on GitHub. By sharing it, we hope to assist other organizations seeking to create their own codes of conduct, fostering inclusive and supportive work environments throughout the industry.

The engineering team is super excited about our Code of Conduct. Weâ€™ve made it [available on GitHub](http://digitalocean.github.io/engineering-code-of-conduct/), and hope that by doing so, we help other groups hoping to craft one for themselves.
